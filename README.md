This project connects to a database of articles and repective information. 

Log.py answers three questions
Q1 - What are the top three most viewed articles in the database
Q2 - How many views do each author have 
Q3 - On what day were there more than 1% error when viewing an article

log.py will contain additional commentary that will guide and explain the process of answering these questions.
